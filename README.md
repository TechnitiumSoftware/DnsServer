# DnsServer
Technitium DNS Server is an open source tool that can be used for self hosting a local network DNS server or, used for experimentation/testing by software developers on their computer. Traditionally, developers use an hosts file for configuring an IP address for a domain under testing. However, using hosts file is cumbersome at times and can only be used to resolve domain name to an IP address.

With a fully configurable DNS server running on your local machine, you can configure not just simple A records (for IP address) but, also configure other types of records like CNAME or MX etc. This allow you to have more control and power when you want to do testing that simulates the exact configuration that you have running on production.

Applications of using a locally hosted DNS server is limited only by the user's imagination!
