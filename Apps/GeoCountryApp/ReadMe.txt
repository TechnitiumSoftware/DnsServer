Using MaxMind GeoIP2 Database
=============================

This app requires MaxMind GeoIP2 database and includes the GeoLite2 version for trial.

For production usage, it is required that you purchase the GeoIP2 database from MaxMind (https://www.maxmind.com/) and use it. 

To update the MaxMind GeoIP2 database for your app, download the GeoIP2-Country.mmdb file and zip it. Use the zip file with the manual Update option.

The app optionally also uses MaxMind ISP/ASN database which can be updated the with same method as above.
