Using MaxMind GeoIP2 Database
=============================

WARNING: Latitude and longitude are not precise and should not be used to identify a particular street address or household.

This app requires MaxMind GeoIP2 database and includes the GeoLite2 version for trial.

For production usage, it is required that you purchase the GeoIP2 database from MaxMind (https://www.maxmind.com/) and use it. 

To update the MaxMind GeoIP2 database for your app, download the GeoIP2-City.mmdb file and zip it. Use the zip file with the manual Update option.

The app optionally also uses MaxMind ISP/ASN database which can be updated the with same method as above.
